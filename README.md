# 1D-Eight-Queens-with-Backtracking-
This code is an implementation of the 8 Queens problem using a 1-D array and backtracking algorithm without using the goto statement. The main function initializes an 8x8 chessboard as an array and sets all values to 0. The program then iterates through each column and row of the array, checking if placing a queen in the current position is valid.
