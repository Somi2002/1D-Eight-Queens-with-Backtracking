# 1D-Eight-Queens-with-Backtracking-
This code is an implementation of the 8 Queens problem using a 1-D array and backtracking algorithm without using the goto statement. The main function initializes an 8x8 chessboard as an array and sets all values to 0. The program then iterates through each column and row of the array, checking if placing a queen in the current position is valid. If it is, the program moves on to the next column. If it's not, it tries the next row. If all rows have been tried and there is no valid position for the queen, the program backtracks to the previous column and tries again. If a valid solution is found, the program prints the board with queen placements.
